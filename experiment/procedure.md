### Procedure

1.Make connections to complete the circuit.<br>
2.Slide the power to ON mode.<br>
3.Increase the voltage from 0 V with an increase of 0.5 V till 9.5V.<br>
4.Measure the corresponding current in ammeter.<br>
5.Fetch the values of current and voltage in Table 1 after every step.<br>
6.Take 10 observations.<br>
7.Decrease the voltage from 10.0 V with a decrease of 0.5 V till 1.0 V.<br>
8.Fetch these values of current and voltage in Table 1.<br>
9.Take observations from Table 1 and place them in Table 2 by the Fetch button.<br>
10.Values of LogP and LogT will be calculated.<br>
11.Plot graph between LogP and Log T by plot data button.<br>
12.Calculate the slope of the graph
