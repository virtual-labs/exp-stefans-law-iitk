For black bodies, Stefan’s law is <br>
E = σ (T<sup>4</sup>-T<sub>0</sub><sup>4</sup>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)<br>
Where E is the net amount of radiation emitted per second per unit area by a body at temperature T and surrounded by another body at temperature T<sub>0</sub>. σ is called Stefan’s constant. A similar relation can also hold for bodies that are not black. In such case, we can write<br>
P = C (T<sup>α</sup> -T<sub>0</sub><sup>α</sup>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	(2)<br>
Where, P is the total power emitted by a body at temperature T surrounded by another at temperature T<sub>0</sub>, α is a power quite closed to 4 and C is some constant depending on the material and area of such a body. Further the relation can be put as <br><br>
P = C T<sup>α</sup> (1-T<sub>0</sub><sup>α</sup>/ T<sup>α</sup>) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	(3)<br><br>
If T>> T<sub>0</sub> (e.g., T = 1500K, and T<sub>0</sub> ≈ 300K), we can write<br><br>
P = C T<sup>α</sup>	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4)<br>
Or<br>
Log<sub>10</sub>P = αLog<sub>10</sub>T + Log<sub>10</sub>C 	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (5)<br><br>
The graph between Log<sub>10</sub>P and Log<sub>10</sub>T should be a straight line whose slope gives α. <br><br> 
When electrical current flows through filament of an electrical bulb, filament gets heated up. There are two modes through which the filament loses heat:<br><br>
1. Conduction and <br>
2. Electromagnetic radiation <br><br>
The heat conducted from the filament increases linearly with temperature. There is very little loss of heat due to convection. The filament resistance is directly proportional to the filament temperature and follows the relation <br><br>
R<sub>t</sub> = R<sub>o</sub>[ 1+α(T-T<sub>o</sub>) ]		&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) <br><br>
Where <br><br>
R<sub>0</sub>   is the resistance of the filament at 0 K.<br>
R<sub>t</sub>    is the resistance of the filament at T (=t <sup>0</sup>C+273) K <br>
α is the temperature coefficient of the resistance of the filament <br>
T is the temperature of the filament in K and <br>
T<sub>0</sub> is the temperature of the filament at 0 K
