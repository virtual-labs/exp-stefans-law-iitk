For black bodies, Stefan’s law is :-

E = σ (T<sup>4</sup>-T<sub>0</sub><sup>4</sup>) .................................(1)

Where E is the net amount of radiation emitted per second per unit area by a body at temperature T and surrounded by another body at temperature T0. σ is called Stefan’s constant. A similar relation can also hold for bodies that are not black. In such case, we can write

P = C (T<sup>α</sup> -T<sub>0</sub><sup>α</sup>)................................(2)

Where, P is the total power emitted by a body at temperature T surrounded by another at temperature T0, α is a power quite closed to 4 and C is some constant depending on the material and area of such a body. Further the relation can be put as

P = C T<sup>α</sup> (1-T<sub>0</sub><sup>α</sup>/ T<sup>α</sup>)..........................(3)

If T>> T<sub>0</sub> (e.g., T = 1500K, and T<sub>0</sub> ≈ 300K), we can write

P = C T<sup>α</sup>............................................(4)

Or

Log<sub>10</sub>P = αLog<sub>10</sub>T + Log<sub>10</sub>C...............(5)

The graph between Log<sub>10</sub>P and Log<sub>10</sub>T should be a straight line whose slope gives α.
