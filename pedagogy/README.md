#### 1. Focus Area : Engineering Physics

<b>About the Experiment:</b> For black bodies, Stefan’s law is<br>

E = σ (T 4 -T 0 4 )                   (1)<br>
Where E is the net amount of radiation emitted per second per unit area by a body at temperature
T and surrounded by another body at temperature T 0 . σ is called Stefan’s constant. A similar
relation can also hold for bodies that are not black. In such case, we can write <br>

P = C (T α -T 0 α )                   (2)<br>
Where, P is the total power emitted by a body at temperature T surrounded by another at
temperature T 0 , α is a power quite closed to 4 and C is some constant depending on the material
and area of such a body. Further the relation can be put as <br>

P = C T α (1-T 0 α / T α )            (3)<br>

If T&gt;&gt; T 0 (e.g., T = 1500K, and T 0 ≈ 300K), we can write<br>

P = C T α                             (4)<br>
Or <br>
Log 10 P = αLog 10 T + Log 10 C       (5)<br>

The graph between Log 10 P and Log 10 T should be a straight line whose slope gives α.

#### 3. Instructional Strategy 
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u> Expository Method
###### Assessment Method: Formative as well as summative.
<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
<b>Experimental setup:</b>
In order to verify Stefan’s law the experimental set up is as shown in Figure 3, with the help of
this setup we have to measure the following two parameters:<br>
1.Power radiated P: We use in this experiment tungsten bulb as the radiating body and in the
steady state the electrical power V.I should be equal to the radiation power P (neglecting
power lost in the leads and through the gas in the bulb).<br>
2.Temperature of the radiating body, T: In our experiment we need measure the temperature of
tungsten filament. This is achieved by measuring the resistance of filament, R t and then using
the relation<br>

R t = R 0 (1+ αt + βt 2 ) (6)<br>
With α and β being known for tungsten, we can find temperature of the filament. One serious
limitation arises in the measurement of R 0 (resistance of filament at 0°C or 273K, one can write
R 0 or R 273 ). At very small current, V/I ratio will give filament resistance as well as lead resistance.
In order to calculate R 0 then we measure the resistance (R g ) at the stage when the filament first
starts glowing and temperature at this stage is approximately 800K. At this temperature
contribution of lead resistance becomes smaller by a factor of 4 as compared with that at 273K.
Therefore measurement of R g (=R 800 ) and using the computed factor, R 800 /R 273, a more accurate
value of R 273 (=R 0 ) is found.<br>
3.With different increasing and decreasing values of current, we adjust such that the bulb glows
each time. Then for value of V and I, ratio V/I is found which gives R g . This is the filament
resistance at 800K. From R t /R 0 vs. T graph, we note that<br>

R t /R 0 = R 800 /R 273 = 3.9 (7)<br>
Therefore, R 800 /3.9 = R 273<br>

Or<br>
R g /3.9 = R 0 (8)<br>
4.Now filament current I is increased from a value below glow stage to values high enough to
get dazzling white light, measuring voltage V across bulb every time. From these V and I
values, we deduce power P (=VI) and R t (=V/I). From R t using the value R 0 (or R g /3.9) or
R 273K , we deduce the temperature T of the filament and obtain a graph in Log 10 P against
Log 10 T.<br>
5.Value of temperature for a particular R t /R 0 can be calculated from the linear fit relation<br>
T= (-2.613)*( Rt/R 0 )^2 + 85.78* (Rt/R 0 ) + 434.8 (9)<br>

<b>Result:</b><br>
Plot the graph as log 10 P vs. log 10 T will be straight line.<br>
<b>Calculations:</b><br>
Slope of the straight line log 10 P vs. log 10 T gives the value of α.
